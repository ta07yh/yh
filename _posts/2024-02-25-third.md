**Instructions:**

**(1)** Begin by preparing the broth. In a large pot, bring the water or anchovy broth to a gentle boil. If you're using a protein like beef or pork, add it now and let it cook until it's almost fully cooked.

**(2)** Add the potatoes, onions, and garlic into the pot. Allow them to simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the potatoes start to soften.

**(3)** Now, it's time to introduce the heart of this stew - the Doenjang. Dilute the Doenjang in a small amount of broth before incorporating it back into the pot. This ensures an even distribution of its rich, umami flavor throughout the stew. If you're in the mood for a bit of spice, add the Gochugaru at this stage.

**(4)** Bring your stew with a 3 tablespoon of tuna fish sauce and sprinkle the green onions on top. The tuna fish sauce  adds a layer of nutty flavor that complements the robustness of the Doenjang.

**(5)** Let your stew simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. This allows all the flavors to meld together beautifully, creating a deep and satisfying base for your Jjigae.

**(6)** As we approach the final stages, add the tofu, and optional chili pepper to the pot. Simmer for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender but still retains a bit of its crunch.

**(7)** Serve your Doenjang Jjigae piping hot, directly from the pot. It's traditionally enjoyed with a bowl of steamed rice and a variety of Korean side dishes, or banchan.
  
This stew is more than just a meal; it's a testament to the simplicity and depth of Korean cuisine. It brings warmth to any table and is a dish I turn to for comfort and joy. I hope you find as much pleasure in making and savoring it as I do.
Wishing you a delightful cooking experience and looking forward to the day we can share a meal together.
