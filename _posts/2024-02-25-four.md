**Marinade**: <br><font color="green">2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red chili paste)</font>
1 tablespoon soy sauce <br>
1 tablespoon sesame oil <br>
1 tablespoon sugar <br>
1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 2-3 cloves) <br>

<strong> <font color="red"> Instructions:</font></strong><br><br>
**[1]Prepare the Marinade:**<br>
 In a large bowl, combine gochujang, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, minced garlic, and black pepper. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth. If you like it spicier, add gochugaru to your preference.<br>

**[2] Marinate the Pork:**<br>
Add the thinly sliced pork to the marinade and mix well to ensure each piece is evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours for more flavor.
Cook the Vegetables:

**[3]** Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced onion and stir-fry for about 5 minutes, or until they start to soften. Remove the vegetables from the pan and set aside.
Cook the Pork:

**[4]** In the same pan, add the marinated pork. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the pork is fully cooked and slightly caramelized, about 7-10 minutes.
Combine and Finish:

**[5]** Add the cooked vegetables back into the pan with the pork. Add the chopped green onions and stir everything together. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
Serve:

**[6]** Serve hot, garnished with toasted sesame seeds and additional green onions if desired. Je-yuk bokkeum is often served with steamed rice and kimchi on the side for a complete meal.

This dish is perfect for a hearty dinner and can be adjusted for heat and sweetness according to your taste.
